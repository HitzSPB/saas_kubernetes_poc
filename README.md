# POC for a attempt on creating a SaaS platform that uses kubernetes/AKS
This repository contains a POC where I attempt to learn how to create a SaaS platform for the company that I am working in. The code is open source as I am using my spare time to make it and not actual company hours. Until the POC is done, it will be separated into different branches depending on the content's phase. Each phase will be a branch of the previous stage.

## Folder structure
src:: The folder will contain all frontend and backend code
deployment:: Will contain all deployment files that belong to kubernetes and similar products
build:: Will contain all content that has something to do with CI/CD
scripts:: will contain all scripts that the user or the build system can run.

## How to debug/run the application
Coming soon

## Phases
### phase 1
Order service with creating and read functionality (no Database)
Kubernetes deployment scripts
API test (Postman)
Performance test (No tool decided yet)
